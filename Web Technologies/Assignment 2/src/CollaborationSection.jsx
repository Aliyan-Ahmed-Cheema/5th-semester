          Only a collaborative ecosystem can unlock the infinite new
          opportunities of 2030
        </h1>
        <p>
          In the interconnected future, no business will be an island, and no
          single organization will be able to dominate the ecosystem of
          opportunities. It will need an open ecosystem driven by collaborative
          partnerships and developer-focused innovation to realize what is truly
          possible. New interaction and governance models and technologies like
          Web3 will enable new kinds of business interaction and trustless value
          exchange between players. A rich, open, innovation-focused ecosystem
          of developers, solution providers and service providers will
          collaborate to realize value, fueled by emerging digital engagement
          tools and as-a-service business models. Service providers will create
          value by exposing their network capabilities through APIs to enable a
          strong developer ecosystem.

              Nokia is bringing this vision to life. Our researchers and

              adapt to emerging applications, use cases, and business models. We
              will work together with our trusted ecosystem partners to develop
              long-term answers to the world's most pressing challenges and
              create a more sustainable, productive, and accessible future. By
              2030, being able to connect to everything will be a big part of
              almost everything we do. Stay tuned for more thought-provoking
              ideas from our experts and valued ecosystem partners.
